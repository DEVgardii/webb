     This is a fairly simple column chart with some bars representing each MLB team
     with the height showing the amount of World Series they have won.  If you move your mouseover or select a bar
     the corresponding label on the map should change to red.

     Some things I learned making this map is that there are a large proportion of teams in the northeast and that the Yankees
     winning all the time made the MLB boring while I was growing up. It seems like some non historically dominant teams have been making
     it deep into the playoffs lately though.  Hopefully the league keeps it up.

  <p>The information for this map came from <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_World_Series_champions'>a wikipedia page about world series champs</a>, with Baseball Team location provided by a <a href='https://github.com/mpmckenna8/GeoJSON-Ballparks'> github repo maintained by James Fee </a> and the map data was taken
  from <a href='https://github.com/mbostock/us-atlas'>Mike Bostocks Atlas repo with some basic datasets mostly derived from US census bureau derived shapefiles.</a>  You can also feel free to help make this all way better:<a href='https://github.com/mpmckenna8/geo/tree/master/chartMap' see the code on github.</a> </p>
